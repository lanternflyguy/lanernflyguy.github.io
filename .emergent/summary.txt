The previous AI engineer successfully built a comprehensive web application based on the user's iterative requests. The development started with a frontend-only mockup of Thelanterflyguy.com, focusing on user-friendliness, mobile responsiveness, and new service pages. Subsequently, the engineer incorporated significant design enhancements, including a custom logo, a dark professional theme, and high-quality imagery, shifting from a white-glove appeal to a broader consumer base. A critical phase involved extensive SEO optimization for local search, creating dedicated landing pages and a strategic action plan. The most recent work focused on adding detailed educational content, including pages on lanternfly reproduction and a patent-pending sterilization technology, and introducing a field service app. The current task revolves around implementing pricing into the website, following the previously drafted pricing structure. The AI consistently used  and  and verified changes with screenshots.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a user-friendly, mobile-responsive website mirroring Thelanterflyguy.com. Initial features included dedicated pages for HOA's, wineries, and municipalities, highlighting services like Spotted Lanternfly removal, prevention, control, and heritage tree root injection protection, along with 100 positive reviews. The design evolved from a basic clone to an upscale, professional aesthetic with a custom logo (city background, bullseye, lanternfly; grey, red, black, white colors), high-quality images of lanternfly stages and tree damage, and a dark background theme. Messaging was later broadened from white-glove clientele to all consumers, incorporating 12 comprehensive commercial services. Subsequent requirements involved extensive local SEO for Nassau County, Suffolk County, Dix Hills, and Long Island wineries, including phone tracking and social media integration. Educational pages on spotted lanternfly reproduction, egg mass inspection, and a patent-pending sterilization approach were added. Latest requests include a page on organic pesticide residual application, changing root treatment to soil treatment, adding AI service videos, adjustable pricing, EPA registration safety info, and branded F150 truck photos. Finally, a field service app for customer logs and GPS tracking was requested, to run simultaneously with the website.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with implementing a user-friendly app that has the ability to submit detailed customer logs to the department of conservation, wants it to run simultaneously to the lanterfly guy website, and have GPS tracking capabilities. The engineer successfully created the frontend component for this new Field Service App at . Following this, the user inquired about the implementation of pricing into the website. The AI acknowledged that while a pricing structure document () was created, the actual pricing display had not yet been integrated into the website. Therefore, the current work involves adding this pricing display to the website so customers can view service costs, which is a direct follow-up to the user's prompt.
